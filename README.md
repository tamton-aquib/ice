# CTF Utils (CTFU)
These are some utilities when playing ctfs. <br/>
Will be changed to a fully functioning binary later.

### NOTES:
- morse uses `_` as dash instead of `-` as of now.

### Todo:
- [ ] substitution
- [x] ~hasher using dehash api~ -> temp not working.
- [ ] Caesar
    - [x] ~simple caesar~
    - [x] ~rot~
    - [ ] vigenere
- [ ] XOR
    - [ ] single byte
    - [ ] hex to hex
    - [ ] string to string
- [ ] BASE
    - [x] ~2: binary~
    - [x] ~8: octal~
    - [x] ~16: hex~
    - [x] ~base32~
    - [x] ~base64~
- [ ] Advanced stuff (maybe wont do this)
    - [ ] ECB and CBC
    - [ ] RSA

- [ ] scoring methods for efficiency.
- [ ] write tests for each mod.
- [ ] Reduce the number of unwraps.
- [ ] Automatic result finding.
